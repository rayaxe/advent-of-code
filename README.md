# Advent of Code solutions in Kotlin

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (AoC) programming puzzles written in Kotlin. My intention was to learn and play around with Kotlin. Don't expect optimal solutions. Look around at https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/ for discussions about AoC  solutions.

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
